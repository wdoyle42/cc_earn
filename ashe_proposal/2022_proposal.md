# Employing Machine-Learning Approaches to Predict Incomes of Recent College Graduates

## Proposal for ASHE 2022  



### Abstract  


This project explores the capabilities of institutional variables in predicting  recent college graduates' earnings via machine-learning approaches. Precursory results support the predictive capabilities of expected institutional characteristics like school classification, while illuminating unexpected predictors like overall debt repayment rates on recent graduate earnings.
