More specifically, the researcher attempts to link institutions with higher figures in the previously mentioned variables to higher Google search activity for the schools. While Huntington does note increases in Google search activity for institutions with higher graduation rates, higher earnings for graduates, etc., it was difficult to derive any meaningful direct links between the Scorecard and search activity \& patterns. However, the researcher emphasizes the possibility of marketing the Scorecard more broadly to increase participation from students less likely to access the Scorecard on their own (low-income, minoritized students). This effort could eventually increase the effect size of the Scorecard on subsequent search activity for institutions.},

Findings determined 20-30\% of variations in median earnings data were informed by major composition and earnings data is very responsive to the metrics that are selected to evaluate quality. Findings also established that percentile earnings informed jumps in institution rankings than median earnings.},

Findings demonstrate that in considering all MSIs institutions included, students enrolled in MSIs had higher earnings in multiple earnings brackets as compared to non-MSIs. This was particularly true for students who enrolled in AANAPISIs and HSIs as compared to students not enrolled in those specific institutional types. Researchers also found no statistically significant difference between earnings for students based on enrollment in MSIs or non-MSIs, paving the way for MSIs to assume the role of agents for economic mobility for low-income, minoritized students.},

However, publication in median earnings (particularly publication of increases in said earnings) resulted in boosts in receipt of SAT scores.

More specifically, he engages presidents at small Catholic institutions (with high % of low SES students) in their understanding of the College Scorecard in terms of its impact and ties to new student enrollment/admissions. Principal findings in this study concluded that the presidents surveyed did not note significant impact or pressure from the Scorecard in making changes to admissions policies and procedures. Ultimately, presidents described the decision-making process in their institution (more specifically, in admissions) as something wholly aligned with and driven by their institutional mission, not by things like Scorecard data. However, they did express concern at the potential for increased usage and reliance on Scorecard data by students/families, noting that this could certainly make institutions feel pressured to present themselves and their data in more positive ways.},
