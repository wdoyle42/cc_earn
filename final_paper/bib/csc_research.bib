@article{Card:2001,
	abstract = {This paper reviews a set of recent studies that
                  have attempted to measure the causal effect of
                  education on labor market earnings by using
                  institutional features of the supply side of the
                  education system as exogenous determinants of
                  schooling outcomes. A simple theoretical model that
                  highlights the role of comparative advantage in the
                  optimal schooling decision is presented and used to
                  motivate an extended discussion of econometric
                  issues, including the properties of ordinary least
                  squares and instrumental variables estimators. A
                  review of studies that have used compulsory
                  schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of
                  schools, and similar features as instrumental
                  variables for completed education, reveals that the
                  resulting estimates of the return to schooling are
                  typically as big or bigger than the corresponding
                  ordinary least squares estimates. One interpretation
                  of this finding is that marginal returns to
                  education among the low-education subgroups
                  typically affected by supply-side innovations tend
                  to be relatively high, reflecting their high
                  marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability
                  that limits their return to education.},

@techreport{Card:1993,
	abstract = {A convincing analysis of the causal link between
                  schooling and earnings requires an exogenous source
                  of variation in education outcomes. This paper
                  explores the use of college proximity as an
                  exogenous determinant of schooling. Analysis of the
                  {NLS} Young Men Cohort reveals that men who grew up
                  in local labor markets with a nearby college have
                  significantly higher education and earnings than
                  other men. The education and earnings gains are
                  concentrated among men with poorly-educated parents
                  -- men who would otherwise stop schooling at
                  relatively low levels. When college proximity is
                  taken as an exogenous determinant of schooling the
                  implied instrumental variables estimates of the
                  return to schooling are 25-60\% higher than
                  conventional ordinary least squares estimates. Since
                  the effect of a nearby college on schooling
                  attainment varies by family background it is
                  possible to test whether college proximity is a
                  legitimately exogenous determinant of schooling. The
                  results affirm that marginal returns to education
                  among children of less-educated parents are as high
                  and perhaps much higher than the rates of return
                  estimated by conventional methods.},
