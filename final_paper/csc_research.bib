More specifically, the researcher attempts to link institutions with higher figures in the previously mentioned variables to higher Google search activity for the schools. While Huntington does note increases in Google search activity for institutions with higher graduation rates, higher earnings for graduates, etc., it was difficult to derive any meaningful direct links between the Scorecard and search activity \& patterns. However, the researcher emphasizes the possibility of marketing the Scorecard more broadly to increase participation from students less likely to access the Scorecard on their own (low-income, minoritized students). This effort could eventually increase the effect size of the Scorecard on subsequent search activity for institutions.},

Principal findings in this study concluded that the presidents surveyed did not note significant impact or pressure from the Scorecard in making changes to admissions policies and procedures. Ultimately, presidents described the decision-making process in their institution (more specifically, in admissions) as something wholly aligned with and driven by their institutional mission, not by things like Scorecard data. However, they did express concern at the potential for increased usage and reliance on Scorecard data by students/families, noting that this could certainly make institutions feel pressured to present themselves and their data in more positive ways.},

abstract = {Recent stories of soaring student debt levels and under-placed college graduates have caused some to question whether a college education is still a sound investment. In this paper, we review the literature on the returns to higher education in an attempt to determine who benefits from college. Despite the tremendous heterogeneity across potential college students, we conclude that the investment appears to payoff for both the average and marginal student. During the past three decades in particular, the earnings premium associated with a college education has risen substantially. Beyond the pecuniary benefits of higher education, we suggest that there also may exist non-pecuniary benefits. Given these findings, it is perhaps surprising that among recent cohorts college completion rates have stagnated. We discuss potential explanations for this trend and conclude by succinctly interpreting the evidence on how to make the most out of college.}

With budget cuts and increasing operational costs, academic institutions are paying more attention to sustaining students’ enrollment in their programs without compromising rigor and quality of education. With the scientific advancements in Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning, universities are increasingly relying on data to predict students’ performance. Many initiatives and research projects addressed the use of students’ behavioral and academic data to classify students and predict their future performance using advanced statistics and Machine Learning. To allow for early intervention, this paper proposes the use of Automated Machine Learning to enhance the accuracy of predicting student performance using data available prior to the start of the academic program.}

author = {Guido W. Imbens},
abstract = {Recently there has been a surge in econometric work focusing on estimating average treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. One strand of this literature has developed methods for estimating average treatment effects for a binary treatment under assumptions variously described as exogeneity, unconfoundedness, or selection on observables. The implication of these assumptions is that systematic (for example, average or distributional) differences in outcomes between treated and control units with the same values for the covariates are attributable to the treatment. Recent analysis has considered estimation and inference for average treatment effects under weaker assumptions than typical of the earlier literature by avoiding distributional and functional-form assumptions. Various methods of semiparametric estimation have been proposed, including estimating the unknown regression functions, matching, methods using the propensity score such as weighting and blocking, and combinations of these approaches. In this paper I review the state of this literature and discuss some of its unanswered questions, focusing in particular on the practical implementation of these methods, the plausibility of this exogeneity assumption in economic applications, the relative performance of the various semiparametric estimators when the key assumptions (unconfoundedness and overlap) are satisfied, alternative estimands such as quantile treatment effects, and alternate methods such as Bayesian inference.}
