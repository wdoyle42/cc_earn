	abstract = {This paper reviews a set of recent studies that
                  have attempted to measure the causal effect of
                  education on labor market earnings by using
                  institutional features of the supply side of the
                  education system as exogenous determinants of
                  schooling outcomes. A simple theoretical model that
                  highlights the role of comparative advantage in the
                  optimal schooling decision is presented and used to
                  motivate an extended discussion of econometric
                  issues, including the properties of ordinary least
                  squares and instrumental variables estimators. A
                  review of studies that have used compulsory
                  schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of
                  schools, and similar features as instrumental
                  variables for completed education, reveals that the
                  resulting estimates of the return to schooling are
                  typically as big or bigger than the corresponding
                  ordinary least squares estimates. One interpretation
                  of this finding is that marginal returns to
                  education among the low-education subgroups
                  typically affected by supply-side innovations tend
                  to be relatively high, reflecting their high
                  marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability
                  that limits their return to education.},

	abstract = {A convincing analysis of the causal link between
                  schooling and earnings requires an exogenous source
                  of variation in education outcomes. This paper
                  explores the use of college proximity as an
                  exogenous determinant of schooling. Analysis of the
                  {NLS} Young Men Cohort reveals that men who grew up
                  in local labor markets with a nearby college have
                  significantly higher education and earnings than
                  other men. The education and earnings gains are
                  concentrated among men with poorly-educated parents
                  -- men who would otherwise stop schooling at
                  relatively low levels. When college proximity is
                  taken as an exogenous determinant of schooling the
                  implied instrumental variables estimates of the
                  return to schooling are 25-60\% higher than
                  conventional ordinary least squares estimates. Since
                  the effect of a nearby college on schooling
                  attainment varies by family background it is
                  possible to test whether college proximity is a
                  legitimately exogenous determinant of schooling. The
                  results affirm that marginal returns to education
                  among children of less-educated parents are as high
                  and perhaps much higher than the rates of return
                  estimated by conventional methods.},

While Huntington does note increases in Google search activity for institutions with higher graduation rates, higher earnings for graduates, etc., it was difficult to derive any meaningful direct links between the Scorecard and search activity \& patterns. However, the researcher emphasizes the possibility of marketing the Scorecard more broadly to increase participation from students less likely to access the Scorecard on their own (low-income, minoritized students). This effort could eventually increase the effect size of the Scorecard on subsequent search activity for institutions.},

Principal findings in this study concluded that the presidents surveyed did not note significant impact or pressure from the Scorecard in making changes to admissions policies and procedures. Ultimately, presidents described the decision-making process in their institution (more specifically, in admissions) as something wholly aligned with and driven by their institutional mission, not by things like Scorecard data. However, they did express concern at the potential for increased usage and reliance on Scorecard data by students/families, noting that this could certainly make institutions feel pressured to present themselves and their data in more positive ways.},

In this paper, we review the literature on the returns to higher education in an attempt to determine who benefits from college. Despite the tremendous heterogeneity across potential college students, we conclude that the investment appears to payoff for both the average and marginal student. During the past three decades in particular, the earnings premium associated with a college education has risen substantially. Beyond the pecuniary benefits of higher education, we suggest that there also may exist non-pecuniary benefits. Given these findings, it is perhaps surprising that among recent cohorts college completion rates have stagnated. We discuss potential explanations for this trend and conclude by succinctly interpreting the evidence on how to make the most out of college.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a surge in econometric work focusing on estimating average treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. One strand of this literature has developed methods for estimating average treatment effects for a binary treatment under assumptions variously described as exogeneity, unconfoundedness, or selection on observables. The implication of these assumptions is that systematic (for example, average or distributional) differences in outcomes between treated and control units with the same values for the covariates are attributable to the treatment. Recent analysis has considered estimation and inference for average treatment effects under weaker assumptions than typical of the earlier literature by avoiding distributional and functional-form assumptions. Various methods of semiparametric estimation have been proposed, including estimating the unknown regression functions, matching, methods using the propensity score such as weighting and blocking, and combinations of these approaches. In this paper I review the state of this literature and discuss some of its unanswered questions, focusing in particular on the practical implementation of these methods, the plausibility of this exogeneity assumption in economic applications, the relative performance of the various semiparametric estimators when the key assumptions (unconfoundedness and overlap) are satisfied, alternative estimands such as quantile treatment effects, and alternate methods such as Bayesian inference.},
